In 1980, the oldest justice on the United States Supreme Court could not have been Justice William O. Douglas because he passed away on January 19, 1980. He was born on October 16, 1898, and served on the Supreme Court from 1939 until his retirement in 1975. Therefore, in 1980, Justice Douglas would not have been a serving justice on the Court at that time since he had already retired five years prior and subsequently passed away in January of that year.
