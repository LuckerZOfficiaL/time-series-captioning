 1. process_data.py: converts raw datasets into json files inside the folder "./data/processed"
 2. sample_generation.py: generates random samples and stores the different files in their own folders in ./data
 3/4. caption_refinement.py || plot_generation.py
 5. extract_facts.py: extract facts that are mentioned in the captions and saves them in the facts folder
 6. filter_facts.py: checks the extracted facts from step 5 and filters out those deemed false
